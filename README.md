## Introduction

Traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and behavior-based approaches (rule based detection approaches), have become increasingly ineffective against the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats. Machine learning and deep learning offer advanced techniques (such as CNN, Random Forest, etc.) to overcome these limitations (low effectivenss against zero-day attacks / threats) by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying intricate patterns, and adapting to evolving threats (thus increasing the probability of detecting new variants of malware)

## Existing Methods

Signature-based detection is based on known malware signatures, while behavior-based detection monitors the behavior of files during execution. These methods struggle to keep up with the rapid evolution of malware and often produce high false-positive rates. This is because these techniques rely on a knowledge base which helps them differentiate malware from benign software. If it comes across a malware which the detector does not have any prior knowledge of, The malware will not be detected. They also have few disadvantages as new-age malwares are strengthened with anti analysis feature to prevent detections in the sandbox.

## Techniques

AIML-based malware detection leverages various techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of malware identification, some of which are:

1. Decision Trees (Static analysis based on API calls and bytecodes)
2. SVM (N-gram analysis of binary files)
3. Random Forest (Analysis of system calls or OPcode sequences)
4. Naive Bayes (Using bag of words or feature vectors)
5. KNN (Feature vectors such as N grams or OPcode sequences)
6. LSTM (Dynamic analysis by analysing long system calls) 




### String Extraction

Machine learning algorithms analyze extracted strings from files to learn patterns and features that distinguish between benign and malicious code. 

*Example*: A string extraction method might identify specific API calls commonly used by ransomware, such as those that manipulate file systems or encrypt files.


### ML-based Antivirus Inspection

ML-powered antivirus inspection harnesses artificial intelligence to analyze vast amounts of data, spot intricate patterns, and continuously improve its accuracy over time.

*Example*: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can be used to analyze network traffic patterns, allowing the system to detect unusual behavior indicative of a malware infection or data exfiltration attempt.


### Disassembly

Machine learning can be applied to the analysis of disassembled code to identify patterns and features indicative of malware at a quicker pace than human data analysts.

*Example*: Disassembly techniques can reveal hidden malicious payloads in executables by analyzing the assembly code for suspicious function calls or control flow changes that are typical in exploit kits.




## Benefits of AIML in Malware Detection

- Increased efficiency and accuracy in malware detection
- Ability to adapt to evolving threats and detect zero-day attacks
- Reduced false-positive rates compared to traditional methods
- Continuous learning and improvement of detection models over time

## Getting Started

To incorporate AIML into your malware detection efforts we have used GANs we have 2 notebook's here one is the ac gan and another is wgans both of these were trained on malimg dataset. 
The main idea of using gans is instead of simply training the model on malicious and benign executables we have trained it on executables that have been syntetically generated as well by the generator so that our discriminator also is able to detect obfuscated malware.
The malimg dataset has converted executabls into image this change in domain of problem statement helps us apply image processing techniques for analysis
