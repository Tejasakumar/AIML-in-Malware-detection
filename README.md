## Introduction

Traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and behavior-based approaches, have become increasingly ineffective against the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats. Machine learning and deep learning offer advanced techniques to overcome these limitations by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying intricate patterns, and adapting to evolving threats.

Signature-based detection relies on known malware signatures, while behavior-based detection monitors the behavior of files during execution. These methods struggle to keep up with the rapid evolution of malware and often produce high false-positive rates. Additionally, new malware variants may incorporate anti-analysis features to evade detection in sandbox environments.

## Techniques

AIML-based malware detection leverages various techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of malware identification:

### String Extraction

Machine learning algorithms analyze extracted strings from files to learn patterns and features that distinguish between benign and malicious code. 

**Example**: A string extraction method might identify specific API calls commonly used by ransomware, such as those that manipulate file systems or encrypt files.

### ML-based Antivirus Inspection

ML-powered antivirus inspection harnesses artificial intelligence to analyze vast amounts of data, spot intricate patterns, and continuously improve its accuracy over time.

**Example**: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can be used to analyze network traffic patterns, allowing the system to detect unusual behavior indicative of a malware infection or data exfiltration attempt.

### Disassembly

Machine learning can be applied to the analysis of disassembled code to identify patterns and features indicative of malware at a quicker pace than human data analysts.

**Example**: Disassembly techniques can reveal hidden malicious payloads in executables by analyzing the assembly code for suspicious function calls or control flow changes that are typical in exploit kits.

## Benefits of AIML in Malware Detection over Rule Based

- Increased efficiency and accuracy in malware detection
- Ability to adapt to evolving threats and detect zero-day attacks
- Reduced false-positive rates compared to traditional methods
- Continuous learning and improvement of detection models over time

## Getting Started

To incorporate AIML into your malware detection efforts, we have utilized GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). We have two notebooks available: one for AC-GAN and another for WGANs (Wasserstein GANs). Both were trained on the MalImg dataset.
#### Why Gans ?
The main idea behind using GANs is that instead of simply training the model on malicious and benign executables, we trained it on executables synthetically generated by the generator. This approach allows our discriminator to better detect obfuscated malware.

The MalImg dataset converts executables into images, which enables us to apply image processing techniques for analysis.
