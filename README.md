## Introduction

Traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and behavior-based approaches (rule based detection approaches), have become increasingly ineffective against the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats. Machine learning and deep learning offer advanced techniques (such as CNN, Random Forest, etc.) to overcome these limitations (low effectivenss against zero-day attacks / threats) by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying intricate patterns, and adapting to evolving threats (thus increasing the probability of detecting new variants of malware)

## Existing Methods

Signature-based detection is based on known malware signatures, while behavior-based detection monitors the behavior of files during execution. These methods struggle to keep up with the rapid evolution of malware and often produce high false-positive rates. This is because these techniques rely on a knowledge base which helps them differentiate malware from benign software. If it comes across a malware which the detector does not have any prior knowledge of, The malware will not be detected. They also have few disadvantages as new-age malwares are strengthened with anti analysis feature to prevent detections in the sandbox.

## Techniques

AIML-based malware detection leverages various techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of malware identification, The following are some of the traditional methods used in Malware Detection using AI / ML:


### String Extraction

Machine learning algorithms analyze extracted strings from files to learn patterns and features that distinguish between benign and malicious code. 

*Example*: A string extraction method might identify specific API calls commonly used by ransomware, such as those that manipulate file systems or encrypt files.


### ML-based Antivirus Inspection

ML-powered antivirus inspection harnesses artificial intelligence to analyze vast amounts of data, spot intricate patterns, and continuously improve its accuracy over time.

*Example*: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can be used to analyze network traffic patterns, allowing the system to detect unusual behavior indicative of a malware infection or data exfiltration attempt.


### Disassembly

Machine learning can be applied to the analysis of disassembled code to identify patterns and features indicative of malware at a quicker pace than human data analysts.

*Example*: Disassembly techniques can reveal hidden malicious payloads in executables by analyzing the assembly code for suspicious function calls or control flow changes that are typical in exploit kits.




## Benefits of AIML in Malware Detection

- Increased efficiency and accuracy in malware detection
- Ability to adapt to evolving threats and detect zero-day attacks
- Reduced false-positive rates compared to traditional methods
- Continuous learning and improvement of detection models over time

## Getting Started

To incorporate AI / ML in malware detection efforts, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Model architecture has been used. Auxilliary Generative Adversarial Networks (AC Gans) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGans) have been implemented and demonstarted in 2 separate Google Collab Notebooks, These models are trained and tested using MalImg dataset.

#### Why GANs

The primary purpose of employing Generative Adversarial Networks for malware detection is that, the discriminator component in a GAN can be trained on synthetically generated malware images with the help of the Generator component, which will generate malware images by adding noise to images present in dataset. On continuous training loops, the generator and discriminator compete with eachother wherein the generator generates malware images which become increasingly difficult for the dicriminator to detect as images of malicious file, and the discriminator learns to detect these malware images based on feedback and adjusting weights. This mechanism increases the accuracy and efficiency of the detector(discriminator) in detecting new malwares.


## Dataset

The Malimg Dataset is a collection of 9786 malware grayscale images representing malwares from 25 classes. This dataset is used for research and development in the area of malware analysis and classification. Here are some key points about the Malimg dataset:
- Content: The dataset includes images of malware binaries, which are represented as grayscale images. Each image in the dataset corresponds to a specific malware sample.
- Purpose: The Malimg dataset is used to develop models for identifying and classifying malware based on visual features. By training models on this dataset, researchers can create systems that detect malware or generate malware-like images for further analysis.
- Structure: The dataset is typically organized into directories, with each directory containing images of a specific type of malware.
