## Introduction

Traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based and behavior-based approaches, have become increasingly ineffective against the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats. Machine learning and deep learning offer advanced techniques to overcome these limitations by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying intricate patterns, and adapting to evolving threats.

## Existing Methods

Signature-based detection relies on known malware signatures, while behavior-based detection monitors the behavior of files during execution. These methods struggle to keep up with the rapid evolution of malware and often produce high false-positive rates.

## Techniques

AIML-based malware detection leverages various techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of malware identification:

### String Extraction

Machine learning algorithms analyze extracted strings from files to learn patterns and features that distinguish between benign and malicious code.

### ML-based Antivirus Inspection

ML-powered antivirus inspection harnesses artificial intelligence to analyze vast amounts of data, spot intricate patterns, and continuously improve its accuracy over time.

### Disassembly

Machine learning can be applied to the analysis of disassembled code to identify patterns and features indicative of malware at a quicker pace than human data analysts.

## Benefits of AIML in Malware Detection

- Increased efficiency and accuracy in malware detection
- Ability to adapt to evolving threats and detect zero-day attacks
- Reduced false-positive rates compared to traditional methods
- Continuous learning and improvement of detection models over time
