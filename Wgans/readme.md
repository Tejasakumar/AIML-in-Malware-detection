# Wgans

A Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) is a type of GAN that improves training stability and addresses issues like mode collapse. It uses the Wasserstein distance (or Earth Mover's distance) as a metric to measure the difference between the real and generated data distributions. This allows for more reliable convergence and better quality in the generated samples.

This repository demonstrates the implementation, training and testing of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) in the context of malware detection. The WGAN model was initially built and trained on the MNIST dataset to verify its functionality, then fine-tuned and trained on the MalImg dataset. The MalImg dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing.

Repository Structure:

1. WGans_impl (2).ipynb:

- Contains the code for constructing the WGAN model from scratch.
- The WGAN is trained on the MNIST dataset to verify the model's basic functionality.

2. WGAN_Malimg_Disc_Train70.ipynb:

- Loads the pre-trained WGAN (trained on MNIST).
- Fine-tunes and trains the model on 70% of the MalImg dataset.

3. WGAN_Malimg_Disc_Testing30.ipynb:

- Loads the WGAN model trained on 70% of the MalImg dataset.
- Tests the model on the remaining 30% of the MalImg dataset.

Dataset and Models:
The MalImg dataset was used for fine-tuning the WGAN model. The dataset was split as follows:

- 70% for training
- 30% for testing

** Important Notes

Environment:
The code was run on Google Colab, using Google Drive for dataset and model storage. If you are using a different platform, modify or remove Colab-specific commands like mounting Google Drive.

File and Directory Paths:
Update all file paths in the code (e.g., dataset loading, model saving) to match your local setup or environment. The paths in the code are specific to our Google Drive setup.
