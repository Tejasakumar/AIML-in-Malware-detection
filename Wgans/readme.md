# Wgans

# About
Initailly a WGAN model was built and trained on MNIST Dataset for the purpose of testing the working of WGAN model.
The same model was trained and tested on MalImg Dataset by creating a split of 70% for training and 30%  for testing.

WGans_impl (2).ipynb contains the code used for construction of WGAN model from scratch and training on MNIST dataset.
WGAN_Malimg_Disc_Train70.ipynb comprises the code which was used to load the (WGAN model trained on MNIST) and train it 70% split of the MalImg dataset.
WGAN_Malimg_Disc_Testing30.ipynb comprises of the code which was used to load (WGAN model trained on 70% of Malimg dataset) and test it on 30% split of the MalImg dataset.

Important Note:

The code scripts were run on google collab, and the dataset, models were imported from and saved to google drive.
Hence, you might find lines of code that are not relevant to the platform you are running the scripts on or throw errors
