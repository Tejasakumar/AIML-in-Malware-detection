# ACGans
### The AC-GAN architecture comprises two models:
Generator: It takes random points from a latent space and a class label as input, and generates images conditioned on the provided class label.
Discriminator: It classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated), and also predicts the class label of the input image
