# AC-GAN Overview

### AC-GAN Architecture

The AC-GAN architecture comprises two models:

- **Generator**: It takes random points from a latent space and a class label as input, generating images conditioned on the provided class label.

- **Discriminator**: It classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated), and also predicts the class label of the input image.

## Getting Started

The `AC_GAN.ipynb` notebook includes both the training code and instructions for loading the model files. The links to the model files are provided in the resources section. 

To load the model, download the model files to your local system and upload them to the runtime environment, and you are good to go. 

If you wish to train only, execute the training section in the notebook.
