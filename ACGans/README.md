# ACGans
### The AC-GAN architecture comprises two models:
Generator: It takes random points from a latent space and a class label as input, and generates images conditioned on the provided class label.
Discriminator: It classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated), and also predicts the class label of the input image

# Getting Started 
The AC_GAN.ipynb is a notebook that has both the training code and loading the model files the links of the model files are given in resources
to load the model download the model on your local system and drop it to the runtime environment and you are good to go 

In case you want to train only then do execute the section of training in the notebook
